## Installation

### Flatpak

```bash
# follow the development setup
poetry build
# see https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder/issues/237 if you have issues with rofiles
flatpak-builder --install --user build sh.oskar.yin_yang.json --force-clean
```

### Arch-based distributions

Yin-Yang can be downloaded from AUR as [yin-yang](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yin-yang) package.

### Source

Yin-Yang depends on `python-systemd` and `pyside6` from pypi. `python-systemd` requires you have installed the systemd-headers from your package manager. You also need python development headers (e.g. `python3-devel`) and the poetry build system for python.
Preferably install `PySide6-Essentials` and `PySide6-Addons` from your system package manager as well.
If they are not available there, uncomment the dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.

For CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc systemd-devel python3-devel libnotify poetry python3-pyside6
```

For OpenSUSE:

```bash
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install gcc systemd-devel libnotify python311-poetry python3-PySide6
```

For Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsystemd-dev gcc pkg-config python3-dev libnotify-bin python3-poetry python3-qtpy-pyside6
```

Then you can install Yin-Yang in a python virtual environment:

```bash
# bash is necessary to run the source command
bash
# Clones the code to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/oskarsh/Yin-Yang.git
cd Yin-Yang
# Installs Yin-Yang
./scripts/install.sh
```

For development, skip the install and instead build python using Poetry. A virtual environment will be created for you:

```bash
# Load into virtual environment
poetry env use python
# Install dependencies
poetry sync
# Load Yin-Yang
poetry run python -m yin_yang
```

### Uninstall

Run `scripts/uninstall.sh` from a terminal and fill out the password.
